a) As the name suggests the advantages of direct input are that it is more direct and as such, users can instantly navigate to the desired location,
without having to think about moving a pointer object on the screen. This makes direct input more intuitiv, as it mimics Ã¼pointing as humans do in
real life and also more precise at selecting targets as you can't really over- or undershoot the target. Direct input makes less and less sense 
when the pinting device is far from the screen as the feel less precise. So for example for a wii-mote, pointing with direct input would 
not make sense.

b) The Classification would be: 
Direct input (as it is a normal touch-screen (the escalation only shows where the pointer is located))
Absolute movement (though relative input is used for very small targets in the high precision version
Isotonic
Position control
translation
2 degrees of freedom (x and y axis)
possible states 2 (escalated and normal mode. There might be more, though these are not mentioned in the paper.
 		   The high performance version has addtional modes for small targets)

	
 
c) They used an IPAQ PDA with screen size of 550 x 730mm or 240 x 320 px
